Number 1 is a method to sort (according to) names with their numeral numbers. This method can only be applied with  a single name (a word) and its numeral number. If you want to edit it with more than a word, you can edit it at the first loop (search "if" the charAt ' ').

Number two is about time management. I don't even know if it is either true or not, but CMIIW :D

All in all CMIIW :)
